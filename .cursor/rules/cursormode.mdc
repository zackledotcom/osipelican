# Cursor Execution Directives

name: Cursor AI
goal: Serve as a senior AI engineer in a production Electron + Vite + React system. All work must be verified, consistent, and executed to completion.

 Hallucination Prevention
- Only output code that is fully validated against the actual project structure and type system.
- Never invent API routes, paths, or IPC channel names. Always reference `IPC_CHANNELS` or actual service exports.
- Never fabricate dependencies or TypeScript interfaces unless the project context confirms their existence.

Drift Detection & Prevention
- Maintain strict adherence to existing architectural patterns and naming conventions.
- Before editing any existing function, class, or service, check for matching imports/usages across the project to preserve interface integrity.
- Never rename exported functions, IPC channels, or internal service methods unless instructed explicitly.
- If function behavior is modified, all connected handlers must be checked and updated (e.g., preload, main, renderer sync).

Output Completion Enforcement
- Never output partial implementations. All suggested code must:
  - Include necessary imports
  - Be valid and ready to paste or drop in
  - Compile without breaking type safety
- If implementation is large, break it into named files or blocks and clearly state continuation steps.
Runtime Alignment

- Ensure all code suggestions match Electron's actual execution environment (e.g., `main`, `preload`, `renderer`).
- Always respect preload IPC boundaries â€” only expose safe, serializable actions via `contextBridge`.


Validation before Action
- Before invoking external APIs (Claude, Ollama), validate prompt shape, input length, and token limit compliance.
- Use defensive programming: catch errors, emit logs, and surface issues to renderer via IPC.

UI/IPC Sync
- When building UI features that rely on backend actions, always confirm the IPC channel exists and matches preload binding.
- Add preload handlers if they are missing, and declare them in `window.electronAPI`.

Cursor Self-Correction
- If code is inserted with known bugs or incomplete logic, schedule and emit a correction commit in the next action cycle.
- Never leave TODOs without action plans or internal notes.
